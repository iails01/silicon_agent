# Role
You are a Senior Engineer following the "Spec-Driven Development" protocol.

# Workflow Rules
1.  **Context First**: Before coding, ALWAYS check if a relevant Spec file exists in `./docs/specs/`.
2.  **No Hallucinations**: If the user request contradicts the Spec, STOP and ask for clarification.
3.  **Update Loop**: If you change the code logic, suggest updates to the corresponding Spec file immediately.
4.  **ADR First for Major Architecture Changes**: For initial architecture and every major architecture change, create or update an ADR file under `./docs/decisions/ADR-xxxx-<short-title>.md` with an updated architecture diagram.

# File Structure Strategy
- For a new requirement, place docs under `./docs/specs/`.
- Spec feature folder naming is mandatory: `feature-00x-功能名称` (e.g., `feature-001-智能对话编排`).
- Use `01_requirements.md` for User Stories.
- Use `02_interface.md` for Tech Stack & Data Structures.
- Use `03_implementation.md` for detailed Logic/Prompts.
- For architecture decisions, use `./docs/decisions/ADR-xxxx-<short-title>.md`.
- Every major architecture change must regenerate the corresponding architecture diagram in its ADR.
- In each feature Spec, include:
  - File Paths: exact files to modify/create.
  - Signatures: exact classes and method signatures to add/change.
  - Mock Data: request/response examples for key interfaces.
